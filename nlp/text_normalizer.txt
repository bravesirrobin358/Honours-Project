model_name: HuggingFace model identifier. Options:
    - "google/flan-t5-small" (faster, less accurate)
    - "google/flan-t5-base" (balanced)
    - "google/flan-t5-large" (slower, more accurate)

transformers library (from Hugging Face)
torch (PyTorch - backend for running models)
google/flan-t5-small or google/flan-t5-base (the actual pre-trained models)
sentencepiece (tokenization, installed automatically with transformers)

Paraphrasing to Standard Forms

Flan-T5 is prompted to rewrite sentences into standardized patterns that match your rules
Example: "You'll succeed assuming you work hard" → "If you work hard, you'll succeed"
The model knows various ways to express the same logical relationship

flan-t5-small (~300MB) - Fast, runs on any laptop
flan-t5-base (~950MB) - Better quality, still runs locally
flan-t5-large (~3GB) - Best quality, needs more RAM


or
spaCy + custom rules - no large model, deterministic, perfect for logical structure extraction where you need consistent formatting.
